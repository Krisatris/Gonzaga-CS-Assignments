You should say what you mean, the March Hare went on.
I do, Alice hastily replied; at least - at least I mean what I say - that's the same thing, you know.
Not the same thing a bit! said the Hatter. You might just as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat what I see"!
You might just as well say, added the March Hare, that "I like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!
You might just as well say, added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, that "I breathe when I sleep" is the same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!
