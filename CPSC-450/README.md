# CPSC 450 - Design and Analysis of Complex Algorithms - Spring 2021 - Professor Shawn Bowers

Advanced study of computer algorithms not covered in CPSC 223 along with principles and techniques  
of computational complexity. Topics could include dynamic programming, B-trees, minimum spanning trees,  
Floyd and Warshall algorithms, various string matching algorithms, computational geometry, exponential  
growth of round-off errors, NP-completeness and reducibility.

Assignments were completed in C++. Makefiles are omitted.
